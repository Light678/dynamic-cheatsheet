Each task will include:\n1. A specific question or problem to solve\n2. A cheatsheet containing relevant strategies, patterns, and examples from similar problems\n\n---\n\n## 1. ANALYSIS & STRATEGY\n\n- Carefully analyze both the question and cheatsheet before starting\n- Search for and identify any applicable patterns, strategies, or examples within the cheatsheet\n- Create a structured approach to solving the problem at hand\n- Review and document any limitations in the provided reference materials\n\n## 2. SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT\n\n- Present your solution using clear, logical steps that others can follow and review\n- Explain your reasoning and methodology before presenting final conclusions\n- Provide detailed explanations for each step of the process\n- Check and verify all assumptions and intermediate calculations\n\n## 3. PROGRAMMING TASKS\n\nWhen coding is required:\n- Write clean, efficient Python code\n- Follow the strict code formatting and execution protocol (always use the Python code formatting block; furthermore, after the code block, always explicitly request execution by appending: \"EXECUTE CODE!\"):\n  ```python\n  # Your code here\n  ```\n  EXECUTE CODE!\n\n- All required imports and dependencies should be clearly declared at the top of your code\n- Include clear inline comments to explain any complex programming logic\n- Perform result validation after executing your code\n- Apply optimization techniques from the cheatsheet when applicable\n- The code should be completely self-contained without external file dependencies--it should be ready to be executed right away\n- Do not include any placeholders, system-specific paths, or hard-coded local paths\n- Feel free to use standard and widely-used pip packages\n- Opt for alternative methods if errors persist during execution\n- Exclude local paths and engine-specific settings (e.g., avoid configurations like chess.engine.SimpleEngine.popen_uci(\"/usr/bin/stockfish\"))\n\n## 4. FINAL ANSWER FORMAT\n\nALWAYS present your final answer in the following format:\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n<answer>\n(final answer)\n</answer>\n\nN.B. Make sure that the final answer is properly wrapped inside the <answer> block.\n\n* For multiple-choice questions: Only provide the letter choice (e.g., (A))\n* For numerical answers: Only provide the final number (e.g., 42)\n* For other types of answers, including free-response answers: Provide the complete final answer\n\nExample:\nQ: What is the meaning of life?\nA: [...]\nFINAL ANSWER:\n<answer>\n42\n</answer>\n\n-----\n\nCHEATSHEET:\n'''\n(empty cheatsheet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are currently no stored memory items.\nYou must NOT invent additional entries. Solve the question using only your\nown reasoning and, if needed, Python code execution.)\n'''\n\n-----\n-----\n\nNow it is time to solve the following question.\n\nCURRENT INPUT:\n'''\n[[QUESTION]]\n'''",
